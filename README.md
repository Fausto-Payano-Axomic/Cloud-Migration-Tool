# Cloud Migration Tool
C# Cloud Migration tool that leverages the C# Rest library (https://github.com/axomic/openasset-rest-cs/).


### Sample Usage

Currently the tool synchronously uploads a CSV fed list of files. Over time I'll be expanding, asynchronizing and optimizing the upload processs. The first priority at the moment was to get the tool general UI up and running as well as basic file uploading.
